# Serverless WorkFlow Community of Practice

## Overview

This repository guides developers, architects, and decisioning practitioners looking to leverage serverless technologies while incorporating decisioning logic into their applications.

##Â Serverless workflow

Serverless workflow refers to a workflow or business process that is executed in a serverless computing environment. Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of computing resources needed to run an application or service. This means that the user does not have to provision and manage servers, but instead can focus on writing and deploying their code.
